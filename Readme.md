## Project Status: Unmaintained

As of Aug 7, 2014, **SimpleModal**, a jQuery Plugin, is no longer actively maintained. Over the years, it has been a joy to build and support this project, and I am grateful for the community that grew around it. While I am no longer updating the code or addressing issues, I have decided to leave SimpleModal available on GitHub for archival purposes and for those who might find it useful in its current state.

Please note:
- **No New Features or Updates:** The project will not receive any new features, improvements, or bug fixes.
- **Use at Your Own Risk:** Given the lack of ongoing maintenance, the plugin may not work with newer versions of jQuery or in current web environments. Please consider this when deciding to use or fork the project.
- **Community Contributions:** While I am not actively maintaining SimpleModal, you are welcome to fork the repository and make your own updates. Community contributions have always been a vital part of open source, and I encourage you to continue in that spirit if you find value in this project.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed to SimpleModal over the years, whether through code, comments or simply by using the plugin. Your support and engagement have been deeply appreciated.
